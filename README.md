# Project 7: Interact
## ARTS 445: Net Art SP18

#### 
**Prompt:** 
Create a web-based system that uses online database technologies to facilitate 
a narrowly-defined human-computer-human interaction. Carefully consider the interaction system you’ll use.
What are its inputs and outputs? It’s mechanisms of communication? Resist the desire to grow the 
system—focus on one single exchange. What does your system say about networked communication? How 
does limiting interaction to one pathway expand the potential of that pathway over its previous usefulness
(e.g. as one of many mechanisms of interaction)?
